This is a basic implementation. To add new content:

Add to arrays in data.js (e.g., new job: push to jobs).
For new stats: add to statTypes, then in generateGirl stats object.
Events: add to eventsData, handle new effects in handleChoice.
The code is modular; each file <200 lines. Expand functions as needed.
